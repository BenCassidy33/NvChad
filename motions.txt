you can use (count)(motion) with insert and typing.
"." will repeat previous motion

(search and replace)
search entire text: 
":%s/f/r/d" -> replaces every instance of f with r. will only search for one instance in each line
":%s/f/r/g" -> g /global
captures: 
:%s/int \(.*\);/r/d

int -> "int"
\(.*\); -> any contigus text up to and including ";"

note: the "\"s are a dilimiter to tell vim that the "(" and ")" are regex dilimiter instead of characters to search for

so:
    int x = 5; // do something 
with the command: 
    :%s/int \(.*\);/double y = 10;/
will change to:
    double y = 10; // do something
you can also add "\1" to get the string that you captured with the regex

with that the command would output:
:'<,'>s/int \(.*\);/hello! \1

int x = 5; // do something -> hello! x = 5 // do something
